        When someone says Bubble tea, they are referencing a traditionally cold-served beverage that has a tea base, a milk or fruit flavor, and edible pearlsinside a cup. Bubble tea has many aliases which tends to confuse people. You may have heard one or many of these phrases used, but you should know they all mean the same thing: bubble tea, pearl tea, bubble milk tea, boba, boba fruit tea or tapioca tea. Bubble Tea has become increasingly popular over the past few years. This is in large part due to the new and unique consumption experience of having tasty edible pearls in a beverage!
